# **Data Science**  
*A personal repository dedicated to my self-taught journey in data science, serving as a playground for practicing Python and data analysis. This space documents experiments, projects, and learning milestones in data science techniques, including tools like XGBoost and ARIMA for my undergraduate thesis, as I explore predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and data-driven insights.*
